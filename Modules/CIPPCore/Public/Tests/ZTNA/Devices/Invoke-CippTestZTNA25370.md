When organizations deploy Global Secure Access as their cloud-based network proxy, user traffic is routed through Microsoft's Secure Service Edge infrastructure. Without source IP restoration enabled, all authentication requests and resource access appear to originate from the proxy's IP address rather than the user's actual public egress IP. This creates a significant security gap: threat actors who compromise user credentials can authenticate from any location, and the organization's Conditional Access policies that rely on IP-based location controls become ineffective since all traffic appears to come from the same proxy addresses. Microsoft Entra ID Protection risk detections lose visibility into the original user IP address, degrading the accuracy of risk scoring algorithms that depend on geographic and network anomaly detection. Sign-in logs and audit trails no longer reflect the true source of authentication attempts, hampering incident investigation and forensic analysis. A threat actor exploiting this gap could perform credential stuffing or phishing attacks and subsequently authenticate to tenant resources while bypassing named location policies, trusted IP controls, and IP-based continuous access evaluation enforcement. The attacker's activity would blend with legitimate proxy traffic, delaying detection and extending dwell time. Enabling Global Secure Access signalling in Conditional Access restores the original user source IP to Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Graph, sign-in logs, and audit logs, preserving the integrity of IP-based security controls and risk assessments.
