When enterprise applications lack both explicit assignment requirements AND scoped provisioning controls, threat actors can exploit this dual weakness to gain unauthorized access to sensitive applications and data. The highest risk occurs when applications are configured with the default setting: "Assignment required" is set to "No" *and* provisioning isn't required or scoped. This dangerous combination allows threat actors who compromise any user account within the tenant to immediately access applications with broad user bases, expanding their attack surface and potential for lateral movement within the organization.

While an application with open assignment but proper provisioning scoping (such as department-based filters or group membership requirements) maintains security controls through the provisioning layer, applications lacking both controls create unrestricted access pathways that threat actors can exploit. When applications provision accounts for all users without assignment restrictions, threat actors can abuse compromised accounts to conduct reconnaissance activities, enumerate sensitive data across multiple systems, or use the applications as staging points for further attacks against connected resources. This unrestricted access model is dangerous for applications that have elevated permissions or are connected to critical business systems. Threat actors can use any compromised user account to access sensitive information, modify data, or perform unauthorized actions that the application's permissions allow. The absence of both assignment controls and provisioning scoping also prevents organizations from implementing proper access governance. Without proper governance, it's difficult to track who has access to which applications, when access was granted, and whether access should be revoked based on role changes or employment status. Furthermore, applications with broad provisioning scopes can create cascading security risks where a single compromised account provides access to an entire ecosystem of connected applications and services.

- Evaluate business requirements to determine appropriate access control method. [Restrict a Microsoft Entra app to a set of users](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-restrict-your-app-to-a-set-of-users?wt.mc_id=zerotrustrecommendations_automation_content_cnl_csasci).
- Configure enterprise applications to require assignment for sensitive applications.

- Implement scoped provisioning based on groups, departments, or attributes.
