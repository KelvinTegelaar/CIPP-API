Limiting guest access to a known and approved list of tenants helps to prevent threat actors from exploiting unrestricted guest access to establish initial access through compromised external accounts or by creating accounts in untrusted tenants. Threat actors who gain access through an unrestricted domain can discover internal resources, users, and applications to perform additional attacks. 

Organizations should take inventory and configure an allowlist or blocklist to control B2B collaboration invitations from specific organizations. Without these controls, threat actors might use social engineering techniques to obtain invitations from legitimate internal users.
