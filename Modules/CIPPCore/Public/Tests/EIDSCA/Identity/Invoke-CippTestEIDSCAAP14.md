# Authorization Policy - Users Can Read Other Users

Users should have the ability to read other users' basic profile information to enable collaboration and communication within the organization. However, this should be balanced with privacy and security considerations. This setting controls whether users can discover and view information about other users in the directory.

Completely restricting user discovery may impact collaboration, while allowing full access enables normal business operations such as looking up colleagues, viewing organizational charts, and facilitating communication.
