# Consent Policy Settings - Block user consent for risky apps

User consent should be blocked for applications identified as risky by Microsoft to prevent potential security breaches. Microsoft Entra ID assesses application risk based on various signals, including publisher verification status, permissions requested, and application behavior patterns.

Blocking consent for risky apps provides automatic protection against potentially malicious applications while still allowing users to consent to trusted, low-risk applications (if user consent is enabled).
