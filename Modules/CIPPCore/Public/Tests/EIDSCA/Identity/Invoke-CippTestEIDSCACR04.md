# Admin Consent - Duration

The admin consent request duration should be set to 30 days or less to ensure that consent requests are reviewed and processed in a timely manner. This setting controls how long consent requests remain active before they expire and need to be resubmitted.

A shorter request duration ensures that pending consent requests don't accumulate indefinitely and encourages prompt review and decision-making by administrators. It also helps keep the consent request queue manageable and relevant.
