# Classification and M365 Groups - Allow Guests to become Group Owner

Guest users should not be allowed to become group owners to maintain proper access control and governance over Microsoft 365 groups and teams. Group owners have significant privileges including the ability to add or remove members, modify group settings, and control access to group resources.

Allowing guests to become group owners creates security risks as external users could potentially grant unauthorized access to organizational resources or modify group configurations in ways that conflict with organizational policies.
