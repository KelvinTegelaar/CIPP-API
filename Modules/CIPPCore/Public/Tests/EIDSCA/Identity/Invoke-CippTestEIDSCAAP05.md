# Authorization Policy - Email-Based Subscription Sign-up

Users should not be allowed to sign up for email-based subscriptions that may create security risks or lead to unauthorized service usage. Disabling this feature prevents users from self-provisioning trial subscriptions or services that may not comply with organizational policies or security requirements.

Allowing unrestricted subscription sign-up can lead to shadow IT, data sprawl, and increased security risks as users may store organizational data in unapproved services.
