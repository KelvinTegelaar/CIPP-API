# Consent Policy Settings - Users can request admin consent

Users should be allowed to request administrator consent when they need to use applications that require permissions beyond what they can grant themselves. This creates a formal workflow where users can submit requests for application access, and administrators can review and approve these requests after assessing security implications.

Enabling this setting provides a balance between security and productivity, as users can request access to needed applications while ensuring proper oversight and approval processes are in place.
