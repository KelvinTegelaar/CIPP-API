# Authorization Policy - Email Validation Join

Users should not be allowed to join the tenant using email validation without proper administrative approval. This setting prevents unauthorized users from creating accounts in your tenant simply by validating an email address, which could lead to security breaches and unauthorized access.

Requiring administrative control over tenant joins ensures that all user accounts are properly vetted and approved before gaining access to organizational resources.
