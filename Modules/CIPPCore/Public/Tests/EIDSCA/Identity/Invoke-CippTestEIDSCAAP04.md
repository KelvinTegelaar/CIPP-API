# Authorization Policy - Guest Invite Restrictions

Guest invite permissions should be restricted to administrators and designated guest inviters only to maintain proper control over external access to your Microsoft Entra ID tenant. Limiting who can invite guests helps prevent unauthorized external users from accessing organizational resources and reduces the attack surface.

When all users can invite guests, there is increased risk of data exposure and security incidents, as employees may inadvertently grant access to malicious actors or share sensitive information with unauthorized external parties.
