# Temp Access Pass - State

Temporary Access Pass (TAP) should be enabled to facilitate secure onboarding of passwordless authentication methods. TAP provides a time-limited passcode that can be used once or multiple times to register strong authentication methods such as FIDO2 security keys or set up the Microsoft Authenticator app.

Enabling TAP is particularly important for passwordless authentication rollouts, as it allows administrators to securely bootstrap users into passwordless methods without relying on traditional passwords or less secure alternatives.
