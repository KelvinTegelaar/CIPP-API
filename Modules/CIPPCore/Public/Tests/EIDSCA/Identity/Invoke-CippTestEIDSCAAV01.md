# Voice Call - Disabled

Voice call authentication should be disabled as it is vulnerable to social engineering attacks and SIM swap attacks. Voice calls are less secure than modern authentication methods and should be replaced with more secure alternatives such as the Microsoft Authenticator app or FIDO2 security keys.

Attackers can intercept phone calls through SIM swapping or social engineering telecom providers, making voice calls an unreliable authentication factor. Organizations should migrate users to stronger authentication methods.
