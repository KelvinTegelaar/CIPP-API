# FIDO2 - Key Restrictions

FIDO2 key restrictions should be configured to control which security key models and manufacturers are allowed in your environment. Key restrictions help ensure that only approved, tested security keys that meet your organization's security requirements can be used for authentication.

Organizations can use key restrictions to enforce specific security requirements such as requiring keys with certain certification levels or from approved vendors.
