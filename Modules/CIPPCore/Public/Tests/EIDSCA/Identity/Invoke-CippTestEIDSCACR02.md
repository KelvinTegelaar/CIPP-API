# Admin Consent - Notify Reviewers

Reviewers should be notified when new admin consent requests are submitted to ensure timely review and approval of application access requests. Enabling notifications ensures that consent requests don't go unnoticed and that users receive timely responses to their access requests.

Proper notification configuration helps maintain a responsive admin consent workflow and improves the user experience while maintaining security oversight.
