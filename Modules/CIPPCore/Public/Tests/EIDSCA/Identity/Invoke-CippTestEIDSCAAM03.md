# MS Authenticator - Number Matching

Number matching should be enabled for Microsoft Authenticator push notifications to provide strong protection against MFA fatigue attacks and push notification bombing. With number matching, users must enter a number displayed on their sign-in screen into the Authenticator app, preventing them from accidentally approving fraudulent authentication requests.

This feature significantly reduces the risk of users approving MFA prompts without proper verification, which is a common technique used by attackers in credential compromise scenarios.
