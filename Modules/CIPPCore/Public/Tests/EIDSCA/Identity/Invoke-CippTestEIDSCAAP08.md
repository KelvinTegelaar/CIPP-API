# Authorization Policy - User Consent Policy

User consent for applications should be limited to low-risk, publisher-verified applications only, or disabled entirely to prevent unauthorized data access. Unrestricted user consent allows users to grant applications access to organizational data without proper security review, potentially exposing sensitive information to malicious applications.

Implementing a restrictive consent policy ensures that only trusted applications can access organizational resources and that high-risk permissions require administrator approval.
