# Admin Consent - Reminders

Reminders should be enabled for pending admin consent requests to ensure that reviewers don't forget to review and respond to user requests. Regular reminders help maintain an efficient consent workflow and prevent user frustration from delayed responses.

Configuring appropriate reminder intervals ensures that consent requests are reviewed in a timely manner while not overwhelming reviewers with excessive notifications.
