# Classification and M365 Groups - Allow Guests to have access to groups content

Guest access to Microsoft 365 groups content should be carefully controlled based on your organization's collaboration requirements and security policies. When enabled, guests can access group resources including SharePoint sites, Teams content, and group files. However, organizations should assess whether guest access is necessary and implement appropriate controls.

Consider your organization's collaboration needs and data sensitivity when configuring this setting. For highly secure environments, disabling guest access may be appropriate, while collaboration-focused organizations may enable it with proper oversight.
