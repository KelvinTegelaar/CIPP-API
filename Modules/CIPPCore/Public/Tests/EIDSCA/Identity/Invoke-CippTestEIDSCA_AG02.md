# Authentication Methods - Report Suspicious Activity

Users should be enabled to report suspicious multifactor authentication prompts they did not initiate. This feature allows users to report fraudulent MFA attempts directly from the Microsoft Authenticator app or via phone call, which helps detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts and credential compromise.

When users report suspicious activity, Microsoft Entra ID can take automated actions such as blocking the user's account, requiring a password reset, or triggering security alerts for administrators to investigate potential compromises.
