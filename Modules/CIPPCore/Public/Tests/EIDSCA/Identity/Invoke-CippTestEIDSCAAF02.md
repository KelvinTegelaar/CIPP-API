# FIDO2 - Self-Service

Self-service registration for FIDO2 security keys should be enabled to allow users to register their own security keys without requiring administrator intervention. This improves user experience and accelerates the adoption of passwordless authentication while maintaining security.

Enabling self-service registration empowers users to take control of their authentication security and reduces the administrative burden of manually provisioning security keys for users.
