# Password Rule Settings - Password Protection Mode

Password protection mode should be set to "Enforce" to actively block weak passwords and prevent users from setting passwords that appear on Microsoft's banned password list or your custom banned password list. When set to Enforce mode, weak password attempts are blocked in real-time, providing immediate protection against easily compromised credentials.

Enforce mode applies to both cloud-only users and users whose passwords are synchronized from on-premises Active Directory (when Azure AD Password Protection for Windows Server Active Directory is deployed).
