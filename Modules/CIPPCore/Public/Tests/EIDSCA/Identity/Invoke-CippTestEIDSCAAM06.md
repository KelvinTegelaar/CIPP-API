# MS Authenticator - Show App Name

Application name should be displayed in Microsoft Authenticator push notifications to provide additional context that helps users identify legitimate authentication requests. Showing the app name allows users to verify that the authentication request is for the expected application, reducing the risk of approving fraudulent requests.

This additional context is part of a defense-in-depth strategy that makes it harder for attackers to trick users into approving unauthorized authentication attempts.
