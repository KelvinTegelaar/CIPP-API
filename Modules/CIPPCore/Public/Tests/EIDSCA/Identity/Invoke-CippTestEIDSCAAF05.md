# FIDO2 - Restricted Keys

FIDO2 security key restrictions should be properly configured to define which specific keys are allowed or restricted in your environment. Organizations may choose to enforce key restrictions to ensure standardization, maintain approved vendor lists, or block specific key models that don't meet security requirements.

Properly configured key restrictions help maintain consistent security standards across your FIDO2 security key deployment.
