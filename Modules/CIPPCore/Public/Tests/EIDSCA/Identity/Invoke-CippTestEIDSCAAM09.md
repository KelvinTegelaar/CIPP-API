# MS Authenticator - Show Location

Geographic location information should be displayed in Microsoft Authenticator push notifications to help users identify potentially suspicious authentication requests from unexpected locations. This additional context allows users to quickly recognize when an authentication attempt is coming from a location that doesn't match their current whereabouts.

Location information is particularly useful for detecting credential compromise when attackers attempt to authenticate from different geographic regions.
