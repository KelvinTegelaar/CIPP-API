# MS Authenticator - Number Matching Target

Number matching should be configured to target all users or appropriate user groups to ensure consistent security protections across your organization. Selective enablement may be appropriate during initial rollout phases, but the ultimate goal should be to enable number matching for all users performing MFA.

Proper targeting configuration ensures that security improvements are applied consistently and that all users benefit from enhanced protection against MFA attacks.
