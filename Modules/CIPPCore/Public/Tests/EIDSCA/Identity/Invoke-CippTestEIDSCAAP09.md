# Authorization Policy - Consent for Risky Apps

User consent for risky applications should be blocked to prevent users from granting dangerous permissions to untrusted applications. Risky apps may request excessive permissions or exhibit suspicious behavior that could compromise organizational security.

Microsoft Entra ID can assess application risk based on various factors, and blocking consent for risky apps provides an additional layer of protection against malicious applications.
