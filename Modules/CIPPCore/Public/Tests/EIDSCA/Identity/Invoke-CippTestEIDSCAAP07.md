# Authorization Policy - Guest User Access

Guest user access should be restricted to limit what information external users can view and interact with in your tenant. The most restrictive setting ensures that guest users can only access their own profile information and cannot enumerate other users, groups, or organizational resources.

Unrestricted guest access increases the risk of information disclosure and reconnaissance activities by external parties who may use directory information for targeted attacks.
