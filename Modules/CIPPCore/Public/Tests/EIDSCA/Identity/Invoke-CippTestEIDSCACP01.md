# Consent Policy Settings - Group owner consent for apps accessing data

Group owners should not be allowed to consent to applications accessing group data without proper security review. Allowing group owners to consent to apps can lead to unauthorized data access, as group owners may not fully understand the security implications of granting permissions to third-party applications.

This setting helps prevent data leakage by ensuring that all application consent requests go through proper administrative channels where security assessments can be performed.
