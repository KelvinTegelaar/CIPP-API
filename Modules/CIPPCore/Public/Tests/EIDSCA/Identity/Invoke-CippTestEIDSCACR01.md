# Admin Consent - Enabled

The admin consent request workflow should be enabled to provide a formal process for users to request administrator approval for applications requiring privileged permissions. This workflow creates visibility and control over application consent requests while allowing users to request access to applications they need for their work.

Enabling the admin consent workflow provides a balance between security and productivity by ensuring administrators review high-risk permission requests while streamlining the process for users to request access to needed applications.
