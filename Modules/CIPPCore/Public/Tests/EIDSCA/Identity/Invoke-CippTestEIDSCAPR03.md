# Password Rule Settings - Enforce custom list

A custom banned password list should be enforced to block passwords that are specific to your organization, such as company names, product names, locations, or industry-specific terms that attackers might use in targeted password attacks.

The custom banned password list complements Microsoft's global banned password list to provide organization-specific protection against weak passwords. This helps prevent users from choosing passwords that may be easily guessed based on knowledge of your organization.
