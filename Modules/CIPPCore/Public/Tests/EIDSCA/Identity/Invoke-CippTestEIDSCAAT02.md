# Temp Access Pass - One-Time

Temporary Access Pass should be configured with appropriate usage limits. Setting TAP to one-time use provides the highest security by ensuring the passcode cannot be reused after initial authentication. However, organizations may choose to allow multiple uses based on specific use cases such as registering multiple authentication methods.

The configuration should balance security requirements with the specific use cases for TAP in your organization, such as user onboarding workflows or authentication method recovery scenarios.
