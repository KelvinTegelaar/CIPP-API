# FIDO2 - State

FIDO2 security keys should be enabled as an authentication method to provide users with the strongest, most phishing-resistant form of authentication available. FIDO2 security keys use public key cryptography and are resistant to phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and password database breaches.

Enabling FIDO2 security keys is a critical step toward passwordless authentication and provides the highest level of security for protecting user accounts, particularly for administrators and high-value targets.
