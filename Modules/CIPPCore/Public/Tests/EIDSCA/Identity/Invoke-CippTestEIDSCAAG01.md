# Authentication Methods - Policy Migration

The authentication methods policy migration should be completed to use the modern authentication methods framework in Microsoft Entra ID. The modern policy provides enhanced features, better security controls, and improved management capabilities compared to legacy multi-factor authentication settings.

Completing the migration ensures you can take advantage of new authentication features such as FIDO2 security keys, certificate-based authentication, and other modern authentication methods that are only available in the new policy framework.
