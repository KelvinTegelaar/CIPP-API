# MS Authenticator - Show App Name Target

Application name display should be configured to target appropriate user groups to ensure consistent security context is provided across your organization. Proper targeting ensures that all users receive additional context in their authentication prompts to help them make informed decisions about approving or denying authentication requests.

Organizations should enable this feature for all users performing MFA to maximize security benefits.
