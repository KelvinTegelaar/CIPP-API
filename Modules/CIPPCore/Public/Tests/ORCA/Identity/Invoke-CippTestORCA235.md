SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records should be configured for all custom domains to specify which mail servers are authorized to send email on behalf of your domain. Properly configured SPF records help prevent email spoofing and improve email deliverability by allowing receiving servers to verify that messages claiming to be from your domain actually originate from authorized sources.
