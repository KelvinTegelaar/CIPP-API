Anti-spam policies should not have entire domains configured in the allow list. Allowing entire domains to bypass spam filtering can expose your organization to phishing attacks and malware, especially if the allowed domain is compromised or used by multiple organizations. Domain-based allow lists should be avoided, and sender-specific allow lists should be used sparingly only for verified business relationships.
