The Bulk Complaint Level (BCL) threshold determines when bulk email messages are treated as spam. Microsoft recommends setting this value between 4 and 6 to achieve a balance between spam protection and minimizing false positives. A threshold that is too high may allow bulk spam through, while one that is too low may quarantine legitimate bulk email.
