DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) signing should be enabled for all custom domains in your organization. DKIM adds a digital signature to outbound email messages, allowing receiving mail servers to verify that the message was sent from your domain and hasn't been altered in transit. This helps prevent email spoofing and improves email deliverability.
