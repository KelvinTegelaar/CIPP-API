Anti-phishing policies should not include trusted senders or exclusions, as this creates security gaps that attackers can exploit. Excluding senders from anti-phishing protection means those addresses can be spoofed without detection, allowing attackers to bypass impersonation and spoof protection by using excluded addresses in their phishing campaigns.
