Advanced Spam Filtering (ASF) options in anti-spam policies provide additional protection against spam. However, Microsoft recommends disabling most ASF options as they can cause false positives. Standard filtering with Defender for Office 365 is more effective. Only specific ASF options should remain enabled when needed for legacy protection scenarios.
